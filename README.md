# Airline Delay Cause
This is a Udacity nano degree project to analyze airline delay cause data. The goal of the project is to show the major causes of flight delay and also explore any relation between the reasons.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset is maitained by U.S. Department of Transportation with data reported by airlines. The delay reasons reported are carrier, late aircraft, nas (air traffic), weather, and security. There is one record for every airline and airport per month. The other details provided are total flights arriving into airport, cancellations, and divertions.

# Conclusions  

The flight delays can be caused due to multiple reasons. We normally assume weather to be one of bigges reason for flight delays. It was quite suprising to see that delays due to carrier and air traffic (nas) are primary reasons. There were several outliers in the dataset, which made analysis quite difficult. The outliers were overcome by limiting the plot xlim. The dataset for the year 2023 is not complete.
